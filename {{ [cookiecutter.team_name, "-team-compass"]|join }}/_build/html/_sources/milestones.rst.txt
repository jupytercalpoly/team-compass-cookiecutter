=======================
Milestones and roadmaps
=======================

{{cookiecutter.team_name}} organizes its releases and the
items associated with the release using GitHub Issues, Milestones, and in some cases, roadmaps.
These span from specific, actionable items, to more high-level goals of the project that
still require discussion.

In general, **Milestones** contain items that could use immediate help in
implementation and design, and we'd love community members to take a shot
at addressing them. **Roadmaps** tend to signal more abstract ideas, and
often require discussion before distilling them down into specific issues.

.. note::

   The roadmap includes ideas the community is excited about and would like to pursue or discuss further.
   They are **not** meant to exclude other ideas or development (unless we
   explicitly make a decision not to do something).
   
   If you have an idea you'd like to propose, please open an issue or a pull
   request to begin discussion. Over time, the roadmap should be updated as the
   community interests and needs evolve.
