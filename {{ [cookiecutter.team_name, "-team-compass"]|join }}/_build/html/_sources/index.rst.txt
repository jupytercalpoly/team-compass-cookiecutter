Why have a Team Compass?
========================
This repository helps the {{cookiecutter.team_name}} team to set a
course for project activity. Our overriding goal is continuous team and
project improvement.

As projects and their growth evolve rapidly, the contents of this repo
should aid us in setting project direction and adjusting the course as
needed. The repo contains:

- team descriptions and roles 
- team meeting agendas and reports
- roadmap and action plans
- governance and code of conduct

We sail together
================

While we value each others individual strengths and contributions, we succeed
or fail as a team. Whether taking corrective actions for a bug or being
recognized for good work, the team, instead of an individual, shoulders
the burden and success.
