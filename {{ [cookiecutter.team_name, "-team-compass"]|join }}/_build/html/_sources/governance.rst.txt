Team responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Team Organization Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Project Maintainer.** This is a person who has impasse-breaking authority to
   make decisions if the team can not agree. This authority should
   be used exceedingly sparingly. The team leader is expected to grow
   team members so that they can pass on their position to them.
        * Answer questions from new contributors
        * Clears blockages with organization related roles
        * Checks in to see if checklists have been cleared/completed at the first dev meeting of each month. 
-  **Meeting Facilitator.** This person is responsible for coordinating the team meeting. 
        * Create and post meeting agenda
        * Post meeting information and time 
        * Actively engage users and contributors in meeting participation and awareness
-  **Roadmap Coordinator.** This is one of the most crucial roles for the project. A maintained roadmap allows
    users and contributors to understand the team's focus for future improvements. 
        * Open asynchronous discussion for roadmap updates
        * Update roadmap promptly
        * Ensure roadmap items and focus is discussed during team meetings

Team Repository roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Repository Maintainer.** 
        * Answers questions from new contributors
        * Clears blockages with repository-related roles 
        * Checks in to see checklists have been completed
- **Milestone Manager.** 
        * Keep github milestone labels up to date for roadmap progress
        * Check milestones are updated and accurate 
        * Be knowledgeable about current repository status and development  
- **Issue Triager.** 
        * Make initial response to issues and assign labels to issues
        * Be knowledgeable about codebase and debugging

There are no other specific roles, but we may revisit this in the
future.
